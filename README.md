## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **Backend Engineer** focused on building **scalable, maintainable, and API-driven backend systems** using Python and modern backend frameworks.

I enjoy working on real-world systems such as **inventory management**, **ticketing platforms**, and **e-commerce backends**, with strong attention to clean architecture, database modeling, and backend performance.

I actively contribute to open-source projects and enjoy collaborating with other developers through GitHub.
